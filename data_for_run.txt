The pasta was undercooked, but the sauce was fantastic.

Friendly staff, but the service was painfully slow.

Delicious desserts! I highly recommend the tiramisu.

Overpriced for the quality of food. Wouldn't visit again.

Nice ambiance, but the music was too loud.

Portions were small but tasted good.

I loved the outdoor seating area.

Drinks were watered down and not worth the price.

Efficient takeout service, but dine-in is chaotic.

Great menu options for vegetarians.
